## Vercel Web Analytics Integration

Successfully implemented Vercel Web Analytics integration for the JaagrMind-v0 React + Vite frontend application.

### What was implemented:

1. **Installed @vercel/analytics package**
   - Added `@vercel/analytics@^1.6.1` to project dependencies
   - Updated package-lock.json with all required transitive dependencies

2. **Integrated Analytics component into the app**
   - Modified `src/App.jsx` to import the `Analytics` component from `@vercel/analytics/react`
   - Wrapped the Routes component with a React Fragment (`<>...</>`)
   - Added the `<Analytics />` component after the Routes to enable tracking throughout the application
   - Component will automatically track page views and user interactions with route support

### Files modified:

- `package.json` - Added @vercel/analytics dependency
- `package-lock.json` - Updated with new dependency and its transitive dependencies
- `src/App.jsx` - Added Analytics import and component integration

### Implementation details:

This React application uses:
- React 18.2.0
- React Router v6 for routing
- Vite as the build tool

The Analytics component was added at the root level of the App component to ensure all pages and routes are tracked. This follows the Vercel Web Analytics best practices for React applications without a framework like Next.js.

### How it works:

Once deployed to Vercel:
1. Web Analytics will be automatically enabled after the next deployment
2. The Analytics component will send telemetry data to `/_vercel/insights/view`
3. Page views and user interactions will be tracked based on route changes
4. Data will be visible in the Vercel dashboard Analytics tab after a few days of user traffic

### Next steps:

1. Deploy the application to Vercel using `vercel deploy` or by connecting the Git repository
2. Enable Web Analytics in the Vercel dashboard (Project > Analytics tab > Enable)
3. After a few days of user traffic, analytics data will be available in the dashboard
4. Optional: Add custom events using the `track()` function from @vercel/analytics/react to track user interactions like button clicks or form submissions

### Testing:

- Build verified successfully with `npm run build`
- No breaking changes introduced
- Existing functionality preserved
- Application bundles correctly with the Analytics component included
